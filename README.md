# Steps on how to use this:
 - Use app.drift.trade to get your .csv data
- Open up a Google Colab Notebook
- Input the .csv files via the regular file upload, or from your Google drive
- Create separate dataframes for each .csv file as shown in the code
- Create the input files as shown in the example and the function should take care of the rest

  
Note: Using output_file='ExampleName.html' will create a .html file in the file section of the notebook which you can download to view a full-page version of the graph instead of making the graph on the notebook.
